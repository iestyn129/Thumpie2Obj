# Thumpie2Obj
A quick and dirty tool for convert the models from the hit 2010 game Thumpies by Big Blue Bubble to Wavefront OBJ (`.obj`) files.

## Usage
Simply run:
```shell
python thumpie2obj.py <models.bin>
```
With `<models.bin>` replaced by actual models file you wish to convert (i.e. noobie01.bin).
## Note
If you notice any issues or inconsistencies with the models this program makes open an issue.
I did not make this to accurately extract models, but only to see if I could, so I did skip things.
